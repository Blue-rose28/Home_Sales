# Home Sales Data Analysis with PySpark

This project aims to analyze home sales data using PySpark SQL. I employ Spark to establish temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

## Files Included

- `Home_Sales_colab.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing PySpark code for data analysis.
- `README.md`: This file providing information about the project.

## Technologies:

- Python 
- PySpark
- Google Colab
- Jupyter notebook

## Usage
1. Download the provided `Home_Sales_colab.ipynb` notebook to you computer.
2. Run this file on Google Colab. Ensure that Spark 3.5.0 alongside hadoop 3 is already installed. The file contains Java as a dependency, which should be loaded while running it.
